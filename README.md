# HeadCounter
 
🔌📡 Turning Concepts into Reality! 🧑‍🔬
We are thrilled to present our Semester 2 project from the EN1190 Engineering Design Project module at Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering - University of Moratuwa: "The Head Counter" 🚀

Our dedicated team has successfully developed an advanced "Head Counter" system capable of accurately counting the number of people in a room. 📊
🎉 Our group's successful demonstration showcased the practical applications of this innovation, including crowd management, and more.

📍 Dual-Door Capability: The Head Counter is designed to support two doors simultaneously, allowing for accurate counting of the total number of people entering or leaving through multiple entrances.

🔗 Stay tuned as we continue to explore the frontiers of technology through innovation, teamwork, and unwavering dedication! 🌐
